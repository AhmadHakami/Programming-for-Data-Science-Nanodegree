### SELECT and FROM in Every SQL Query

Every query will have at least a  `SELECT`  and  `FROM`  statement. The  `SELECT`   statement is where you put the  **`columns`**  for which you would like to show the data. The  `FROM` statement is where you put the  **`tables`**  from which you would like to pull data.
