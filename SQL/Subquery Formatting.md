# Subquery Formatting

When writing  **Subqueries**, it is easy for your query to look incredibly complex. In order to assist your reader, which is often just yourself at a future date, formatting SQL will help with understanding your code.

The important thing to remember when using subqueries is to provide some way for the reader to easily determine which parts of the query will be executed together.

### Badly Formatted Queries

Though these poorly formatted examples will execute the same way as the well formatted examples, they just aren't very friendly for understanding what is happening!

Here is the first, where it is impossible to decipher what is going on:

```
SELECT * FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day, channel, COUNT(*) as events FROM web_events GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;
```

This second version, which includes some helpful line breaks, is easier to read than that previous version, but it is still not as easy to read as the queries in the  **Well Formatted Query**  section.

```
SELECT *
FROM (
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
channel, COUNT(*) as events
FROM web_events 
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;
```

### Well Formatted Query

Now for a well formatted example, you can see the table we are pulling from much easier than in the previous queries.

```
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
                channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2
      ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub;
```

Additionally, if we have a  **GROUP BY**,  **ORDER BY**,  **WHERE**,  **HAVING**, or any other statement following our subquery, we would then indent it at the same level as our outer query.

The query below is similar to the above, but it is applying additional statements to the outer query, so you can see there are  **GROUP BY**  and  **ORDER BY**  statements used on the output are not tabbed. The inner query  **GROUP BY**  and  **ORDER BY**  statements are indented to match the inner table.

```
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
                channel, COUNT(*) as events
      FROM web_events 
      GROUP BY 1,2
      ORDER BY 3 DESC) sub
GROUP BY day, channel, events
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

These final two queries are so much easier to read!
